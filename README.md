> Community maintained repo of all of the developer oriented Events + Orgs + Meetups happening in Lisbon (also with reference to available Venues)

You are welcome to submit pull request to add more info or edit the one that is present.

In this repo, you can find

- `meetups` - Links to the tech meetup groups
- `channels` - Where people usually talk about stuff (fb groups, IRC/gitter channels, mailing lists, etc)
- `talks` - This one is hard to maintain, but potentially, it is a one page resource to learn about all the topics that are being discussed/presented plus their following slides+talk videos
- `venues` - If you are looking for a venue to host a meetup, typically the venues listed in this .md file are very happy to provide you with space and empower the dev community
- `events` - Events that happen at least once a year, so you can plan ahead :)
